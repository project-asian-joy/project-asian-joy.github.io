                        <p class = "text">The chrysanthemum blooms vibrantly in the fall, thriving when most flowers wither, symbolizing resilience and vitality in the face of adversity. In China, the chrysanthemum is celebrated during the Double Ninth Festival (Chongyang Festival), a time associated with honoring the elderly and paying tribute to the deceased. The festival, whose name sounds like "longevity" in Chinese, typically involves activities such as climbing, enjoying Chongyang cakes, admiring chrysanthemums, and caring for the elderly.</p>

As the shape slowly takes form, the display vividly illustrates how beauty—much like Chinatown’s evolving narrative—unfolds over time, and how resilience is cultivated gradually, rather than achieved in a single day.</p>

                            <p class = "text">Anita Yip is a multidisciplinary artist whose works honor and uplift underheard voices and cultures through documentary photography, journalism, curated experiences, and new media. Exploring the intricate relationships between art, archives, and identity within the interplay of cultural truths and fictions, she poses the question: "What is remembered, and what is lost?" Her art confronts and mediates painful experiences, lack of representation, and scarcity or even the absence of resources.</p>
                            <p class = "text">Embracing the symbolism of the thousand bloom—an emblem of unity and collective strength that reflects Boston Chinatown’s long history of solidarity and resilience—Anita is making her public art debut with a project that celebrates both joy and perseverance.</p>
